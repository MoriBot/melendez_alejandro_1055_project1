##SVG Icon MarketPlace Assignment
In this assignment we had to make a one page website with an icon library with a theme of our choice. There must be at least 10 icon to select from, and all must be animated using javascriprt for interactivity.

##Getting Started
You can start the process by downloading or cloning the files in the repository on github onto your local device. Open up your choice of text editor and open the index.html file in your browser. Now you're ready to go!

##Prerequisites
There are no instalation needs for this software! Be free to download and work

##Running the tests
There are no automated tests for this system, but you can manually test the buttons and expect a reaction out of each one

All icons will have a selected state in which they are differently color, as well as be set back to the deselected state

Menu options should be animated when clicked on, and slightly change color when hovered over

##Built With
Illustrator - used to make the icons and design
Atom - the text editor used for code

##Versioning
This is the only version of this code!
